# DrugOverdose_in_USA

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting drug overdose trends in the United States using historical data. The goal is to identify patterns, explore underlying causes, and build predictive models to forecast future overdose incidents, potentially aiding in public health initiatives.

Project Overview
Drug overdose is a significant public health concern in the United States. This project utilizes data science techniques to analyze overdose trends over time, uncover contributing factors, and develop machine learning models to predict future overdose cases. By understanding these patterns, the project aims to contribute to preventive measures and improved policy-making.
